## Project Overview:

### Objective:

I wish to collect the career stats of top picks from the past 20 NBA drafts. I will compare numerical stats among players in drafts using graphs and visualization techniques and will also explore interesting relationships among the scraped data with different visualization techniques.

### Tasks:

1. From www.basketball-reference.com/draft, scrape the rookie stats of the top 10 overall picks of last 20 NBA drafts (2001 - 2020)
2. Scrape data into a single Pandas MultiIndexDataFrame with outer index of draft year and inner index of pick number
3. Run DataFrame manipulations and various visualization techniques to gain insight into questions regarding drafting teams, picks, and player stats.

*** In this analysis, "Drafting teams" includes teams that trade for a pick. Drafting teams are teams that a rookie plays for for the entire season. Therefore, teams that trade or receive picks midway through the season will not be counted in this analysis.

### Here are some of the plots and realizations from the 7 analysis questions:



### Libraries Involved:
Requests, Beautiful Soup, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
