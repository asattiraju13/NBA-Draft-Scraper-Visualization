# NBA-Draft-Scraper-Visualization

### Project Overview:

#### Objective:

I wish to collect the career stats of top picks from the past 20 NBA drafts. I will compare numerical stats among players in drafts using graphs and visualization techniques and will also explore interesting relationships among the scraped data with different visualization techniques.
#### Tasks:

1. From www.basketball-reference.com/draft, scrape the rookie stats of the top 10 overall picks of last 20 NBA drafts (2001 - 2020)
2. Scrape data into a single Pandas MultiIndexDataFrame with outer index of draft year and inner index of pick number
3. Run EDA and visualizations to compare top 10 picks in drafts and visualize relationships between the scraped data.
